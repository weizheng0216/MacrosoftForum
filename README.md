## User Guide
---    

        The users can use the following link to access to our platform.
        
        (https://cse216-macrosoft.herokuapp.com/)
        
        After loading the website, the users will see the interface like this:
       
       
        - From the image, we can see that there is a button "Make a Post." 
        
        When users want to share some ideas, you can click that.
        
        Then a new window will be opened. From there, we can see three text boxes, 
        “Title,” “Username/Anonymous,” and “Message“. 
        So users can write down the message title, their userid or choose to stay anonymous, 
        and then type the message.
        Username/Anonymous is for identification but users can stay anonymous. Type Messages is for users to 
        drop down their ideas. All these three boxes are required to fill out. If not, an error message will show up. 
        Except the three text boxes, there are three buttons, Hide, Clear, and Send. 
    
        - Users can hide the “Make a Post” window if they choose halt their thoughts for a second 
        and view other people’s thoughts. 
        Clicking “Clear” button helps to delete what users have written down if they decide to start over. 
        “Send” is for users to post their ideas. After clicking “send,” the users can see their post on the platform. 
	    On the platform, we can see that there are many posts. Each post frame has a couple attributes. 
        On the top of the post frame, we have the time stamp colored by gray indicating when the poster sent out the post.
        Following that are the message title, message, and the username. 
    
        - The last two attributes are for the function, up-vote and down-vote. 
        The users can choose to click these two buttons based on their opinions.
	    In addition, we also have a function for pinning the ideas. 
        For the pinned messages, the entire post frame is colored by yellow. 
        Before the time stamp, there is a pin icon indicating it is a pinned message.
	    On the top left of the entire platform next to our platform name “Macrosoft Buzz,” we have the sorting functions. 
        The users can choose to sort the post wither by the date posted or the vote counts based on their preferences.
